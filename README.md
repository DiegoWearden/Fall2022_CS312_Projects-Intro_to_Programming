# CS312 Fall 2022 Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during the Fall 2022 semester for the CS312 course. Each project focuses on specific concepts and programming techniques, aiming to enhance understanding and proficiency in different areas of computer science. Below is a brief overview of each project:

## ConnectFour
- This project explores the implementation of 2D arrays and involves the development of a fully functional game of Connect Four. The game allows players to engage in strategic gameplay, aiming to connect a line of their tokens before their opponent does.

## Critters
- In the Critters project, the focus is on object-oriented programming principles. The main objective was to design and create a critter class capable of defeating all other critters in a simulated game environment.

## GuitarHero
- The GuitarHero project is centered around arrays of objects. It involves the development of a ring buffer to facilitate the functionality of a digital guitar, allowing users to play and generate sound through designated input mechanisms.

## Hangman
- This project delves into string manipulation techniques by implementing a game of Hangman. Users can play the game, trying to guess the hidden word within a limited number of attempts.

## HomeField Advantage
- The HomeField Advantage program aims to determine if there is a statistically significant home field advantage in a given dataset. It involves the analysis of provided data to draw conclusions regarding the impact of the home playing environment.

## I Know an Old Lady
- In the I Know an Old Lady project, the focus is on understanding and utilizing methods in programming. The program involves the development of a system to create and manipulate instances of objects representing an old lady, showcasing the usage of methods to modify object behavior.

## Personality Quiz
- This project focuses on arrays and their implementation. The program allows users to answer a series of questions to determine their personality type based on the given answers. The program provides feedback on the personality type based on the input.

## RockPaperScissors
- The RockPaperScissors project involves the development of a fully functional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a computer opponent. Users can play the game and test their luck against the bot's choices.

## Scintillation Grid
- This project explores the concept of parameters in programming. It involves the creation of methods to print out different-sized squares on a drawing panel, allowing users to customize and visualize grids of various dimensions.

## Substitution Cipher
- The Substitution Cipher program focuses on encryption and decryption techniques. It allows users to encode and decode text using a substitution cipher algorithm, providing a secure and confidential means of communication.

## UT Tower
- The UT Tower project emphasizes the usage of for loops in programming. It involves creating a method with for loops to dynamically adjust the size of a printed representation of the UT tower by modifying a global constant.
