## Projects

### I Know an Old Lady

Through this project, I delved into understanding methods and their usage. By developing this program, I gained valuable insights into effectively structuring code and utilizing methods for better code organization and reusability.

### UT Tower

Using for loops, I successfully created a dynamic program that can change the size of a printed UT Tower. This project deepened my understanding of for loops' capabilities and their role in controlling program execution flow.

### Scintillation Grid

By exploring parameters and graphics, I developed methods to print out different-sized squares on a drawing panel. This project enhanced my grasp of parameter usage and expanded my understanding of graphics manipulation.

### Rock Paper Scissors

Developing a working game of Rock Paper Scissors against a bot enabled me to dive into boolean logic and while loop implementation. This project strengthened my ability to incorporate iterative control structures into my programs.

### Hangman

Through implementing a game of Hangman, I learned about string manipulation techniques. This project honed my skills in handling strings, including input validation, storing and comparing data, and building interactive user experiences.

### HomeField Advantage

The HomeField Advantage program aimed at exploring arrays. By developing this program, I gained proficiency in working with arrays, performing computations, and utilizing arrays to extract relevant information or make informed decisions.

### Personality Quiz

Developing a program for a personality quiz allowed me to dive into more advanced array implementation. Through this project, I deepened my understanding of arrays and their versatility in storing and manipulating data, enabling dynamic program behaviors based on user input.

### Substitution Cipher

To understand searching and sorting, I created a program that enables users to decode certain encrypted text using a substitution cipher. This project involved utilizing search and sorting algorithms, enhancing my problem-solving abilities and fostering a deeper comprehension of efficient data manipulation.

### Connect Four

By developing a functioning game of Connect Four, I explored the concepts of 2D arrays. This project expanded my understanding of multidimensional data structures, implementing game logic, and enhancing user interaction.

### Critters

Through the development of a critter battling game, I delved into the realm of object-oriented programming (OOP). This project provided valuable insights into designing and implementing classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, fostering skills crucial to successful OOP practices.

### Guitar Hero

Creating a ring buffer for sound on a digital guitar enabled me to comprehend arrays of objects. This project improved my understanding of managing, manipulating, and accessing arrays of objects, ensuring smooth sound playback and user interaction.
